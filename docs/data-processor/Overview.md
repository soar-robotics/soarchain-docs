# Overview

The GitHub repository, named `"soarchain-data-processing-framework,"` is dedicated to a robust data processing solution for handling vehicle data from an `MQTT` broker. The repository is designed to efficiently subscribe to the `MQTT` broker, retrieve vehicle PID `(Parameter ID)` information, and store the raw data into a `CSV` file for further analysis.

## Key Features

- **MQTT Integration**: Seamless integration with an `MQTT` broker for real-time data ingestion.

- **Data Storage**: Captures vehicle `PIDs` and persistently stores them in a `CSV` file for historical reference and analysis.

- **PID Mapping**: Utilizes a mapping mechanism to associate raw `PIDs` with their corresponding descriptions and values.

- **Dataset Creation**: Generates a new dataset by mapping `PIDs` to actual descriptions and values, providing a more comprehensible and usable data structure.

- **Documentation**: Includes detailed tutorials, documents, and technical specifications to guide users through the setup, operation, and understanding of the data processing workflow.

## Data Processing Sequence

Accessing vehicle data within SoarChain involves the creation of a Data Provisioning Request (DPR), which serves as a data acquisition request with defined characteristics. Through the DPR, users can specify the duration for acquiring data, set budgets for rewarding vehicle drivers, and more.

Follow these steps to access vehicle data in SoarChain:

1- **Create a Wallet**: Begin by setting up an account within the SoarChain network using the SoarChain mobile application. Comprehensive details can be found in the [SoarChain Documentaion](https://docs.soarchain.com/)

2- **Submit genDpr Transaction:**: Trigger a genDpr transaction on the SoarChain network, marking the initiation of a Data Processing Request with customized parameters.

3- **DPR Creation**: Following the transaction submission, a corresponding Data Processing Request `(DPR)` object is generated and recorded on the chain.

4- **Automatic Topic Creation**: The system automatically creates a topic, `"/dpr/{your_dpr_id},"` in SoarChain brokers. Motus mini devices transmit vehicle data to this topic. Leveraging the SoarChain Data Processing Framework facilitates seamless access to your requested data.

5- **dpr_listener Script Execution**: Execute the `dpr_listener` script with the correct broker information. This script reads data from SoarChain brokers, streaming the data into a designated file of your choice.

6- **Data Transformation**: When data received it is time to transfer the `PIDs` to real values and description and compute the data

7- **Compute and Save Data**: The SoarChain Data Processing Framework plays a pivotal role in computing data, converting PIDs into real values and descriptions. The processed data is then diligently saved into a `CSV` file, ready for analysis and interpretation

After plugging the Motus mini to the vehicle's OBD2 port, the Motus mini will flash a red light meaning it is connected correctly and ready for the setup. 

### Pairing Motus mini with your mobile phone

Once you complete ste steps above, please open your ***Motus Secure Provisioning***. If prompted, allow your phone’s camera to be used by the app.

From the ***Motus Secure Provisioning*** app, press  **```Provision Device```**  to start the provisioning and then scan the QR code which can be found inside the Motus mini box.

### Select your phone's hotspot on the Motus Secure Provisioning App

>
**!! Attention !! --** 
Before continuing with the next step, please make sure that your **Cellular Data** and **Personal Hotspot** settings are on. 

After scanning the QR code you will be prompted to a ```Select Wi-Fi Network``` screen where available Wi-Fi networks near you are listed. To continue seting up your Motus mini, please select your phone’s personal hotspot name from the available network names listed on the app. If you don’t see your phone’s name on the screen, please press refresh icon on the top right.

#### Android 
The phone’s hotspot name is written at ```Settings > Connections > Mobile Hotspot & Tethering > Mobile Hotspot```

#### iPhone
The phone’s hotspot name is the same as the iPhone’s name. You can check your phone’s name from ```Settings > Apple ID```, it is written on the bottom where all of your Apple based devices are listed.  

If you don’t see your phone’s name on the screen, toggle back to the ```Settings > Personal Hotspot``` screen (image below) and quickly come back to the app again and refresh the screen from the icon on the top right corner. This is a common issue observed while using iPhone's hotspot feature.
